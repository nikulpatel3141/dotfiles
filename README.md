# My Dotfiles

These are my configuration files for [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com/) and [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim).

This is intentionally minimal: you get a decently productive setup with minimal effort.

## Neovim

This config is based on [this](https://github.com/LunarVim/nvim-basic-ide) starting point.

### Setup

Install Neovim > 0.8 ([appimages](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim#appimage-universal-linux-package) are a convenient way to do this on most Linux systems) and copy the `neovim` folder to `~/.config/`.


## Fish Config

I'm using [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) as a plugin manager for Fish and the [Tide](https://github.com/IlanCosman/tide) theme which already provides a lot of functionality out of the box.

My only addition is to alias [Exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) as a (slightly) better ls.

### Setup

Install Fish + Fisher + Tide and copy the `config.fish` file to `~/.config/fish/`.
